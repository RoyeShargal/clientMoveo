The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\\n' + 'way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\\n' + 'insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\\n' + 'seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\\n' + 'was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\\n' + '\\n' + 'In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\\n' + 'full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\\n' + 'and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\\n' + 'himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\\n' + 'caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\\n' + 'strange conjectures.\\n' + '\\n' + 'As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\\n' + 'skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\\n' + 'face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\\n' + 'closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\\n' + 'to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\\n' + 'might awake.\\n' + '\\n' + '“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\\n' + 'Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\\n' + 'Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\\n' + 'gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\\n' + 'able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\\n' + 'I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.

My dear\\n' + 'fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\\n' + 'do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\\n' + 'you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\\n' + 'only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\\n' + 'not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\\n' + 'all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\\n' + 'old men are ever capable of any emotion.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\\n' + 'it. I have put too much of myself into it.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\\n' + '\\n' + '“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\\n' + 'were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\\n' + 'your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\\n' + 'Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\\n' + 'my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\\n' + 'intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\\n' + 'where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\\n' + 'of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\\n' + 'sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\\n' + 'horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\\n' + 'How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\\n' + 'then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\\n' + 'age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\\n' + 'and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\\n' + 'Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\\n' + 'whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\\n' + 'that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\\n' + 'in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\\n' + 'when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\\n' + 'yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\\n' + 'not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\\n' + 'look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\\n' + 'There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\\n' + 'the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\\n' + 'steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\\n' + 'The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\\n' + 'at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\\n' + 'they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\\n' + 'should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\\n' + 'neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\\n' + 'Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\\n' + 'whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\\n' + 'for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\\n' + 'studio towards Basil Hallward.\\n' + '\\n' + '“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“But why not?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\\n' + 'names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\\n' + 'to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\\n' + 'mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\\n' + 'one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\\n' + 'am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\\n' + 'I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\\n' + 'one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\\n' + 'to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\\n' + 'makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\\n' + 'never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\\n' + 'When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\\n' + 'down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\\n' + 'most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\\n' + 'than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\\n' + 'when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\\n' + 'she would; but she merely laughs at me.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\\n' + 'Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\\n' + 'believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\\n' + 'thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\\n' + 'fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\n' + 'Your cynicism is simply a pose.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\\n' + 'cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\\n' + 'garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\\n' + 'stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\\n' + 'polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\\n' + '\\n' + 'After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\\n' + 'going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\\n' + 'answering a question I put to you some time ago.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\\n' + '\\n' + '“You know quite well.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I do not, Harry.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\\n' + 'won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I told you the real reason.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\\n' + 'yourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\\n' + 'portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\\n' + 'of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\\n' + 'not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\\n' + 'the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\\n' + 'this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\\n' + 'my own soul.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\\n' + '\\n' + '“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\\n' + 'over his face.\\n' + '\\n' + '“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\\n' + 'him.\\n' + '\\n' + '“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\\n' + '“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\\n' + 'believe it.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\\n' + 'the grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\\n' + 'replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\\n' + '“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\\n' + 'is quite incredible.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\\n' + 'lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\\n' + 'languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\\n' + 'blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\\n' + 'wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\\n' + 'beating, and wondered what was coming.\\n' + '\\n' + '“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\\n' + 'months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\\n' + 'artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\\n' + 'remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\\n' + 'white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\\n' + 'a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\\n' + 'about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\\n' + 'academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\\n' + 'me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\\n' + 'When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\\n' + 'of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\\n' + 'one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\\n' + 'do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\\n' + 'itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\\n' + 'yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\\n' + 'own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\\n' + 'Then—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\\n' + 'tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\\n' + 'a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\\n' + 'exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\\n' + 'not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\\n' + 'no credit to myself for trying to escape.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\\n' + 'is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\\n' + 'However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\\n' + 'to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\\n' + 'stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\\n' + 'Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\\n' + 'pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\\n' + '\\n' + '“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\\n' + 'with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\\n' + 'parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\\n' + 'once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\\n' + 'some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\\n' + 'been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\\n' + 'nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\\n' + 'face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\\n' + 'stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\\n' + 'It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\\n' + 'Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\\n' + 'would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\\n' + 'that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\\n' + 'to know each other.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\\n' + 'companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\\n' + 'guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\\n' + 'gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\\n' + 'ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\\n' + 'everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\\n' + 'like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\\n' + 'exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\\n' + 'entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\\n' + 'to know.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\\n' + 'listlessly.\\n' + '\\n' + '“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\\n' + 'opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\\n' + 'say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\\n' + 'inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\\n' + 'anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\\n' + 'Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\\n' + 'the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\\n' + '\\n' + 'Hallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\\n' + 'Harry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\\n' + 'one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\\n' + 'and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\\n' + 'glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\\n' + 'summer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\\n' + 'between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\\n' + 'acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\\n' + 'intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\\n' + 'have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\\n' + 'power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\\n' + 'me? I think it is rather vain.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\\n' + 'merely an acquaintance.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\\n' + 'and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\\n' + '\\n' + '“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\\n' + 'relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\\n' + 'other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\\n' + 'with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\\n' + 'of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\\n' + 'immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\\n' + 'us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\\n' + 'poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\\n' + 'magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\\n' + 'proletariat live correctly.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\\n' + 'more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\\n' + 'patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\\n' + 'Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\\n' + 'puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\\n' + 'never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\\n' + 'only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\\n' + 'oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\\n' + 'the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\\n' + 'are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\\n' + 'will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\\n' + 'wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\\n' + 'discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\\n' + 'better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\\n' + 'than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\\n' + 'How often do you see him?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\\n' + 'absolutely necessary to me.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\\n' + 'your art.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\\n' + 'think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\\n' + 'world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\\n' + 'and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\\n' + 'What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\\n' + 'Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\\n' + 'some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\\n' + 'him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\\n' + 'more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\\n' + 'dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\\n' + 'that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\\n' + 'and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\\n' + 'work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\\n' + 'will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\\n' + 'new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\\n' + 'differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\\n' + 'way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\\n' + 'thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\\n' + 'has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\\n' + 'me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\\n' + 'visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\\n' + 'Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\\n' + 'that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\\n' + 'perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\\n' + 'body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\\n' + 'have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\\n' + 'Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\\n' + 'landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\\n' + 'which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\\n' + 'done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\\n' + 'sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\\n' + 'first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\\n' + 'always looked for and always missed.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\\n' + 'some time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\\n' + 'a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\\n' + 'He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\\n' + 'He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\\n' + 'curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\\n' + 'colours. That is all.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\\n' + '\\n' + '“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\\n' + 'all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\\n' + 'cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\\n' + 'anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\\n' + 'soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\\n' + 'their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\\n' + 'much of myself!”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\\n' + 'is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\\n' + 'beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\\n' + 'live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\\n' + 'autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\\n' + 'will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\\n' + 'never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\\n' + 'the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\\n' + 'fond of you?”\\n' + '\\n' + 'The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\\n' + 'after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\\n' + 'I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\\n' + 'be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\\n' + 'in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\\n' + 'is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\\n' + 'pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\\n' + 'one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\\n' + 'decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n' + '“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\\n' + 'of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\\n' + 'accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\\n' + 'ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\\n' + 'something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\\n' + 'facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\\n' + 'well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\\n' + 'thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\\n' + '_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\\n' + 'its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\\n' + 'you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\\n' + 'out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\\n' + 'will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\\n' + 'he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\\n' + 'perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\\n' + 'alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\\n' + 'one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\\n' + 'that it leaves one so unromantic.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\\n' + 'Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\\n' + 'too often.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\\n' + 'faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\\n' + 'know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\\n' + 'silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\\n' + 'satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\\n' + 'a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\\n' + 'and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\\n' + 'swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\\n' + 'people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\\n' + 'seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\\n' + 'were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\\n' + 'amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\\n' + 'with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\\n' + 'to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\\n' + 'been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\\n' + 'lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\\n' + 'virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\\n' + 'The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\\n' + 'eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\\n' + 'all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\\n' + 'turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Remembered what, Harry?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\\n' + '\\n' + '“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\\n' + 'me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\\n' + 'in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\\n' + 'that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\\n' + 'of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\\n' + 'earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\\n' + 'creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\\n' + 'about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Why?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I don’t want you to meet him.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“You don’t want me to meet him?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“No.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\\n' + 'the garden.\\n' + '\\n' + '“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\\n' + '\\n' + 'The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\\n' + '“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\\n' + 'bowed and went up the walk.\\n' + '\\n' + 'Then he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\\n' + 'said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\\n' + 'right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\\n' + 'him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\\n' + 'marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\\n' + 'gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\\n' + 'depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\\n' + 'the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\\n' + '\\n' + '“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\\n' + 'by the arm, he almost led him into the house.\\n' + '\\n' + '\\n' + '\\n' + '\\n' + 'CHAPTER II.\\n' + '\\n' + '\\n' + 'As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\\n' + 'his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\\n' + '“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\\n' + 'learn them. They are perfectly charming.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\\n' + 'myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\\n' + 'wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\\n' + 'blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\\n' + 'pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\\n' + 'have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\\n' + 'have spoiled everything.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\\n' + 'Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\\n' + 'spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\\n' + 'afraid, one of her victims also.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\\n' + 'funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\\n' + 'with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\\n' + 'have played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\\n' + 'she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\\n' + 'And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\\n' + 'audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\\n' + 'the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\\n' + 'laughing.Street. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\\n' + 'you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\\n' + 'too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\\n' + 'horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\\n' + 'him to stay. I insist upon it.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\\n' + 'gazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\\n' + 'am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\\n' + 'for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\\n' + '\\n' + 'The painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\\n' + 'that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\\n' + 'and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\\n' + 'says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\\n' + 'exception of myself.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\\n' + 'martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\\n' + 'he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\\n' + 'delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\\n' + 'moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\\n' + 'Henry? As bad as Basil says?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\\n' + 'immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Why?”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\\n' + 'not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\\n' + 'virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\\n' + 'sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\\n' + 'actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\\n' + 'self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\\n' + 'of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\\n' + 'forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\\n' + 'self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\\n' + 'the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\\n' + 'out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\\n' + 'which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\\n' + 'religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\\n' + 'boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\\n' + 'had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\\n' + '\\n' + '“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\\n' + 'that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\\n' + 'him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\\n' + 'were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\\n' + 'every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\\n' + 'believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\\n' + 'would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\\n' + 'Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\\n' + 'may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\\n' + 'mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\\n' + 'that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\\n' + 'that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\\n' + 'sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\\n' + 'purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\\n' + 'or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\\n' + 'to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\\n' + 'the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\\n' + 'monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\\n' + 'the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\\n' + 'brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\\n' + 'also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\\n' + 'rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\\n' + 'thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\\n' + 'dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\\n' + '\\n' + '“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\\n' + 'to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\\n' + 'Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\\n' + '\\n' + 'For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\\n' + 'eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\\n' + 'influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\\n' + 'really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\\n' + 'him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\\n' + 'them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\\n' + 'but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\\n' + '\\n' + 'Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\\n' + 'music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\\n' + 'chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\\n' + 'were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\\n' + 'And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\\n' + 'to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\\n' + 'own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\\n' + 'so real as words?\\n' + '\\n' + 'Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\\n' + 'He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\\n' + 'seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\\n' + 'it?\\n' + '\\n' + 'With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\\n' + 'psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\\n' + 'He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\\n' + 'and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\\n' + 'which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\\n' + 'wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\\n' + 'He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\\n' + 'fascinating the lad was!\\n' + '\\n' + 'Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\\n' + 'the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\\n' + 'only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\\n' + '\\n' + '“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\\n' + 'out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\\n' + '\\n' + '“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of\\n' + 'anything else. But you never sat better.

myBook='he artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and\\n' +\n    'conceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate\\n' +\n    'into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\\n' +\n    'things.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\\n' +\n    'Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\\n' +\n    'being charming. This is a fault.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\\n' +\n    'cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\\n' +\n    'beautiful things mean only beauty.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\\n' +\n    'written, or badly written. That is all.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\\n' +\n    'his own face in a glass.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\\n' +\n    'not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\\n' +\n    'the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\\n' +\n    'the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\\n' +\n    'anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\\n' +\n    'ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\\n' +\n    'mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\\n' +\n    'everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\\n' +\n    'art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\\n' +\n    'point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\\n' +\n    'musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\\n' +\n    'type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\\n' +\n    'surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\\n' +\n    'peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\\n' +\n    'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\\n' +\n    'complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\\n' +\n    'himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\\n' +\n    'does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\\n' +\n    'one admires it intensely.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'All art is quite useless.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'OSCAR WILDE\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'CHAPTER I.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\\n' +\n    'summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\\n' +\n    'the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\\n' +\n    'perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\\n' +\n    'lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\\n' +\n    'Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\\n' +\n    'blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\\n' +\n    'bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\\n' +\n    'the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\\n' +\n    'tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\\n' +\n    'producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\\n' +\n    'those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\\n' +\n    'an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\\n' +\n    'swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\\n' +\n    'way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\\n' +\n    'insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\\n' +\n    'seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\\n' +\n    'was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\\n' +\n    'full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\\n' +\n    'and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\\n' +\n    'himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\\n' +\n    'caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\\n' +\n    'strange conjectures.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\\n' +\n    'skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\\n' +\n    'face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\\n' +\n    'closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\\n' +\n    'to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\\n' +\n    'might awake.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\\n' +\n    'Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\\n' +\n    'Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\\n' +\n    'gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\\n' +\n    'able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\\n' +\n    'I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\\n' +\n    'is really the only place.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head\\n' +\n    'back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\\n' +\n    'Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\\n' +\n    'the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\\n' +\n    'from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear\\n' +\n    'fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\\n' +\n    'do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\\n' +\n    'you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\\n' +\n    'only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\\n' +\n    'not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\\n' +\n    'all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\\n' +\n    'old men are ever capable of any emotion.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\\n' +\n    'it. I have put too much of myself into it.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\\n' +\n    'were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\\n' +\n    'your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\\n' +\n    'Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\\n' +\n    'my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\\n' +\n    'intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\\n' +\n    'where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\\n' +\n    'of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\\n' +\n    'sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\\n' +\n    'horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\\n' +\n    'How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\\n' +\n    'then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\\n' +\n    'age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\\n' +\n    'and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\\n' +\n    'Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\\n' +\n    'whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\\n' +\n    'that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\\n' +\n    'in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\\n' +\n    'when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\\n' +\n    'yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\\n' +\n    'not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\\n' +\n    'look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\\n' +\n    'There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\\n' +\n    'the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\\n' +\n    'steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\\n' +\n    'The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\\n' +\n    'at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\\n' +\n    'they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\\n' +\n    'should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\\n' +\n    'neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\\n' +\n    'Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\\n' +\n    'whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\\n' +\n    'for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\\n' +\n    'studio towards Basil Hallward.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“But why not?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\\n' +\n    'names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\\n' +\n    'to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\\n' +\n    'mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\\n' +\n    'one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\\n' +\n    'am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\\n' +\n    'I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\\n' +\n    'one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\\n' +\n    'to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\\n' +\n    'makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\\n' +\n    'never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\\n' +\n    'When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\\n' +\n    'down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\\n' +\n    'most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\\n' +\n    'than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\\n' +\n    'when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\\n' +\n    'she would; but she merely laughs at me.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\\n' +\n    'Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\\n' +\n    'believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\\n' +\n    'thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\\n' +\n    'fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\n' +\n    'Your cynicism is simply a pose.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\\n' +\n    'cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\\n' +\n    'garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\\n' +\n    'stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\\n' +\n    'polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\\n' +\n    'going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\\n' +\n    'answering a question I put to you some time ago.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“You know quite well.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I do not, Harry.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\\n' +\n    'won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I told you the real reason.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\\n' +\n    'yourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\\n' +\n    'portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\\n' +\n    'of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\\n' +\n    'not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\\n' +\n    'the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\\n' +\n    'this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\\n' +\n    'my own soul.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\\n' +\n    'over his face.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\\n' +\n    'him.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\\n' +\n    '“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\\n' +\n    'believe it.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\\n' +\n    'the grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\\n' +\n    'replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\\n' +\n    '“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\\n' +\n    'is quite incredible.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\\n' +\n    'lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\\n' +\n    'languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\\n' +\n    'blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\\n' +\n    'wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\\n' +\n    'beating, and wondered what was coming.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\\n' +\n    'months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\\n' +\n    'artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\\n' +\n    'remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\\n' +\n    'white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\\n' +\n    'a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\\n' +\n    'about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\\n' +\n    'academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\\n' +\n    'me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\\n' +\n    'When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\\n' +\n    'of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\\n' +\n    'one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\\n' +\n    'do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\\n' +\n    'itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\\n' +\n    'yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\\n' +\n    'own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\\n' +\n    'Then—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\\n' +\n    'tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\\n' +\n    'a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\\n' +\n    'exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\\n' +\n    'not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\\n' +\n    'no credit to myself for trying to escape.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\\n' +\n    'is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\\n' +\n    'However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\\n' +\n    'to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\\n' +\n    'stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\\n' +\n    'Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\\n' +\n    'pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\\n' +\n    'with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\\n' +\n    'parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\\n' +\n    'once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\\n' +\n    'some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\\n' +\n    'been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\\n' +\n    'nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\\n' +\n    'face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\\n' +\n    'stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\\n' +\n    'It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\\n' +\n    'Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\\n' +\n    'would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\\n' +\n    'that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\\n' +\n    'to know each other.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\\n' +\n    'companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\\n' +\n    'guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\\n' +\n    'gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\\n' +\n    'ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\\n' +\n    'everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\\n' +\n    'like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\\n' +\n    'exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\\n' +\n    'entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\\n' +\n    'to know.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\\n' +\n    'listlessly.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\\n' +\n    'opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\\n' +\n    'say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\\n' +\n    'inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\\n' +\n    'anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\\n' +\n    'Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\\n' +\n    'the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Hallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\\n' +\n    'Harry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\\n' +\n    'one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\\n' +\n    'and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\\n' +\n    'glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\\n' +\n    'summer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\\n' +\n    'between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\\n' +\n    'acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\\n' +\n    'intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\\n' +\n    'have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\\n' +\n    'power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\\n' +\n    'me? I think it is rather vain.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\\n' +\n    'merely an acquaintance.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\\n' +\n    'and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\\n' +\n    'relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\\n' +\n    'other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\\n' +\n    'with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\\n' +\n    'of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\\n' +\n    'immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\\n' +\n    'us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\\n' +\n    'poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\\n' +\n    'magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\\n' +\n    'proletariat live correctly.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\\n' +\n    'more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\\n' +\n    'patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\\n' +\n    'Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\\n' +\n    'puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\\n' +\n    'never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\\n' +\n    'only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\\n' +\n    'oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\\n' +\n    'the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\\n' +\n    'are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\\n' +\n    'will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\\n' +\n    'wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\\n' +\n    'discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\\n' +\n    'better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\\n' +\n    'than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\\n' +\n    'How often do you see him?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\\n' +\n    'absolutely necessary to me.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\\n' +\n    'your art.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\\n' +\n    'think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\\n' +\n    'world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\\n' +\n    'and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\\n' +\n    'What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\\n' +\n    'Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\\n' +\n    'some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\\n' +\n    'him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\\n' +\n    'more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\\n' +\n    'dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\\n' +\n    'that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\\n' +\n    'and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\\n' +\n    'work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\\n' +\n    'will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\\n' +\n    'new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\\n' +\n    'differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\\n' +\n    'way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\\n' +\n    'thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\\n' +\n    'has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\\n' +\n    'me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\\n' +\n    'visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\\n' +\n    'Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\\n' +\n    'that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\\n' +\n    'perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\\n' +\n    'body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\\n' +\n    'have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\\n' +\n    'Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\\n' +\n    'landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\\n' +\n    'which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\\n' +\n    'done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\\n' +\n    'sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\\n' +\n    'first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\\n' +\n    'always looked for and always missed.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\\n' +\n    'some time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\\n' +\n    'a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\\n' +\n    'He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\\n' +\n    'He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\\n' +\n    'curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\\n' +\n    'colours. That is all.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\\n' +\n    'all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\\n' +\n    'cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\\n' +\n    'anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\\n' +\n    'soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\\n' +\n    'their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\\n' +\n    'much of myself!”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\\n' +\n    'is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\\n' +\n    'beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\\n' +\n    'live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\\n' +\n    'autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\\n' +\n    'will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\\n' +\n    'never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\\n' +\n    'the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\\n' +\n    'fond of you?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\\n' +\n    'after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\\n' +\n    'I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\\n' +\n    'be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\\n' +\n    'in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\\n' +\n    'is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\\n' +\n    'pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\\n' +\n    'one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\\n' +\n    'decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n' +\n    '“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\\n' +\n    'of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\\n' +\n    'accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\\n' +\n    'ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\\n' +\n    'something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\\n' +\n    'facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\\n' +\n    'well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\\n' +\n    'thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\\n' +\n    '_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\\n' +\n    'its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\\n' +\n    'you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\\n' +\n    'out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\\n' +\n    'will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\\n' +\n    'he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\\n' +\n    'perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\\n' +\n    'alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\\n' +\n    'one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\\n' +\n    'that it leaves one so unromantic.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\\n' +\n    'Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\\n' +\n    'too often.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\\n' +\n    'faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\\n' +\n    'know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\\n' +\n    'silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\\n' +\n    'satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\\n' +\n    'a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\\n' +\n    'and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\\n' +\n    'swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\\n' +\n    'people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\\n' +\n    'seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\\n' +\n    'were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\\n' +\n    'amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\\n' +\n    'with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\\n' +\n    'to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\\n' +\n    'been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\\n' +\n    'lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\\n' +\n    'virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\\n' +\n    'The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\\n' +\n    'eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\\n' +\n    'all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\\n' +\n    'turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Remembered what, Harry?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\\n' +\n    'me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\\n' +\n    'in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\\n' +\n    'that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\\n' +\n    'of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\\n' +\n    'earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\\n' +\n    'creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\\n' +\n    'about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Why?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I don’t want you to meet him.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“You don’t want me to meet him?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“No.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\\n' +\n    'the garden.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\\n' +\n    '“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\\n' +\n    'bowed and went up the walk.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Then he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\\n' +\n    'said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\\n' +\n    'right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\\n' +\n    'him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\\n' +\n    'marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\\n' +\n    'gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\\n' +\n    'depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\\n' +\n    'the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\\n' +\n    'by the arm, he almost led him into the house.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'CHAPTER II.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\\n' +\n    'his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\\n' +\n    '“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\\n' +\n    'learn them. They are perfectly charming.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\\n' +\n    'myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\\n' +\n    'wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\\n' +\n    'blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\\n' +\n    'pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\\n' +\n    'have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\\n' +\n    'have spoiled everything.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\\n' +\n    'Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\\n' +\n    'spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\\n' +\n    'afraid, one of her victims also.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\\n' +\n    'funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\\n' +\n    'with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\\n' +\n    'have played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\\n' +\n    'she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\\n' +\n    'And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\\n' +\n    'audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\\n' +\n    'the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\\n' +\n    'laughing.Street. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\\n' +\n    'you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\\n' +\n    'too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\\n' +\n    'horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\\n' +\n    'him to stay. I insist upon it.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\\n' +\n    'gazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\\n' +\n    'am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\\n' +\n    'for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'The painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\\n' +\n    'that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\\n' +\n    'and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\\n' +\n    'says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\\n' +\n    'exception of myself.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\\n' +\n    'martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\\n' +\n    'he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\\n' +\n    'delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\\n' +\n    'moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\\n' +\n    'Henry? As bad as Basil says?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\\n' +\n    'immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Why?”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\\n' +\n    'not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\\n' +\n    'virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\\n' +\n    'sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\\n' +\n    'actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\\n' +\n    'self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\\n' +\n    'of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\\n' +\n    'forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\\n' +\n    'self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\\n' +\n    'the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\\n' +\n    'out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\\n' +\n    'which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\\n' +\n    'religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\\n' +\n    'boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\\n' +\n    'had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\\n' +\n    'that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\\n' +\n    'him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\\n' +\n    'were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\\n' +\n    'every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\\n' +\n    'believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\\n' +\n    'would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\\n' +\n    'Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\\n' +\n    'may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\\n' +\n    'mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\\n' +\n    'that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\\n' +\n    'that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\\n' +\n    'sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\\n' +\n    'purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\\n' +\n    'or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\\n' +\n    'to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\\n' +\n    'the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\\n' +\n    'monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\\n' +\n    'the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\\n' +\n    'brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\\n' +\n    'also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\\n' +\n    'rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\\n' +\n    'thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\\n' +\n    'dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\\n' +\n    'to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\\n' +\n    'Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\\n' +\n    'eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\\n' +\n    'influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\\n' +\n    'really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\\n' +\n    'him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\\n' +\n    'them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\\n' +\n    'but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\\n' +\n    'music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\\n' +\n    'chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\\n' +\n    'were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\\n' +\n    'And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\\n' +\n    'to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\\n' +\n    'own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\\n' +\n    'so real as words?\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\\n' +\n    'He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\\n' +\n    'seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\\n' +\n    'it?\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\\n' +\n    'psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\\n' +\n    'He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\\n' +\n    'and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\\n' +\n    'which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\\n' +\n    'wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\\n' +\n    'He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\\n' +\n    'fascinating the lad was!\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    'Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\\n' +\n    'the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\\n' +\n    'only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\\n' +\n    '\\n' +\n    '“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\\n' +\n    'out and sit in the garden.
